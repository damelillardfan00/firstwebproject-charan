        <!--paragraph talks about what the agreements and promises between the indeginous people and the government.-->
        <p>When the treaty was created, the government promised to give the Indigenous people special lands, called reserves, where they can hunt, fish, and trap.
            They also promised to give them some things to help, like food, tools, and a tiny bit of money.
        The government said they would also give the leaders and the people some gifts, and there would be money given every year.</p>

        <p>The only really big different thing about this treaty is that the people sadly did not get as much money, food, and tools like other treaties.</p>
