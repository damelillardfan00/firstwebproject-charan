            <h1>Who made Treaty 5?</h1>
        </header>
        <p>A long time ago, in 1875 and 1876,
            an important agreement was made called treaty 5.
            This is a treaty that was signed by the
            <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> government of Canada</span></strong>
            and the Indigenous peoples from around Lake Winnipeg!</p>

        <!--paragraph talks about why treaty 5 was made-->
        <p>A long time ago the Indigenous people of upper Manitoba wanted to make a treaty with the Canada&apos;s government.
            Around this time other groups were making treaties, and they had heard that and wanted their own treaty.
            With other treaties they could get help getting things, like foods and tools, so they also wanted a treaty.
            They were also looking for a better place to live because the land around their homes wasn&apos;t good for farming.
            They needed help, especially since they were struggling to get enough food. 
            At first the government did not want to make a treaty with them but soon after they decided to create one. </p>
